        <p>Results of Ludum Dare 33 got already published so it's time for postmortem.</p>
<p>My main goal - making the game in time for the <em>Compo</em> - has not been fulfiled.
I was far from having anything ready to be send and the deadline has been reached.
After getting some sleep, rest and spending time with a family I decided not to
give up completely and try to finish anything for the <em>Jam</em>.</p>


<p>For these readers who have no clue what's the difference between <abbr title="Ludum Dare">LD</abbr> compo and Jam, 
in really short summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time to post entry to the compo is 48h, while for Jam it's 72h</li>
<li>You are only allowed to work alone in the Compo, but for Jam you might work in a 
  team made of programmers, gfx artists, musicans, etc.</li>
<li>For Compo you must create all assets (graphics, audio) by yourself and all of 
  these need to be made during the 48h of the Compo. For Jam you are allowed to
  use already existing assets.</li>
<li>Compo is very strict and limiting, Jam is more chilled out</li>
</ul>
<h3>Results</h3>

<p>The results are overall better. Keep in mind that in Jam you compete against
teams of people; it's much harder to get better score due to this single fact.
I was really suprised that my overall score was that high as the game was
far from being finished. I've been slowly working on enhancing my graphics
and audio skills and it seems like some progress has been made.</p>
<p>No humor and mood categories as I disabled them.</p>

<h3>What went right</h3>
<p>I won't repeat my goals as they might be found on the previous entry. Let's jump
right into the right things!</p>
<h4>Visuals</h4>
<p>I'm really happy that my pixel-art skills got improved. I was able to create
some animations and (for a beginner) decent looking characters. However, there is
still much more to be improved. My next goal is to be able to produce content
of similar quality to the <a href="http://oryxdesignlab.com/ultimatefantasy">Ultimate Fantasy tileset</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Working on the assets" class="img-thumbnail center-block" src="http://blog.marcinglinski.pl/images/0007-pyxel.jpg" /></p>
<h4>Audio</h4>
<p>Good side of the audio was the music. I've used Bosca Ceoil program for the first
time and it was very easy to create a simple tune. I think it's good idea to stick
to this program for a now and focus on other fields. </p>

<h4>Entity Component System</h4>
<p>Before the <abbr title="Ludum Dare">LD</abbr> I was working on my custom engine based on <abbr title="Entity Component System">ECS</abbr> architecture.
I had no actual game to test if it works properly so <abbr title="Ludum Dare">LD</abbr> was a first real test.
There were nasty bugs that took some time from my developement, but overall
I'm really happy with the architecture. If you start thinking with components
and not game objects, everything magically starts working. If you got your
rendering, physics and audio systems already prepared you might focus on 
actual gameplay because attaching proper components will make everything 
magically work!</p>
<h3>What went wrong</h3>
<h4>Deadline missed</h4>
<p>I was unable to deliver in time an entry for compo. I've lost over 6 hours of 
development due to a basic indexing issue which shouldn't happen to any 
software engineer. I didn't have any physic system ready to be used so I had
to make one by myself. This combined with not tested <abbr title="Entity Component System">ECS</abbr>-based engine resulted
in too much time spent in a debugger trying to figure out what's going on.
Lesson (I hope) learnt and (I hope) next time I'll focus more on actual
gameplay.</p>
<h4>Lack of gameplay</h4>
<p>As I've lost too much time fighting windmills, no planned gameplay
feature has been implemented. My plan was to create a stealth evasion
game with static obstacles, moving enemies with their cone of view, 
sound alarm system, and simple logic puzzle (push this button to activate 
that). </p>
<h4>What next</h4>
<ul>
<li>Add more features to the <a href="https://github.com/silentlamb/mve-engine">mve-engine</a><ul>
<li>Cinematics</li>
<li>Animators</li>
<li>Shaders and processing effects</li>
<li>Input rebinding</li>
<li>Dynamic audio system</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Prepare level parser to be used<ul>
<li>Parse image (png) based maps</li>
<li>Parse PyxelEdit txt format</li>
<li>(optional) Parse Tiled map format</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implement algorithm to reduce unnecessary number of rigid bodies when loading a map</li>
<li>Prepare for LD34 (12-14 Dec, 2015)</li>
<li>Continue improving on pixel arts</li>
</ul>
