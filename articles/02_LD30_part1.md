This article is an imported post from Ludum Dare website. I've posted it
at the day 1 of LD30. It's added here so I can keep everything related to
a gamedev in a single place.

### Let's meet Node54

*skipped introduction*

But I love game development. I read tons of stuff. I try to think about
various algorithms or design patterns that might be used to resolve some
problem that bugs me. The problem is, I haven't finish anything yet. All
of my game development stops on the engine.

So one day, looking at the calendar I saw that my wife with son are
going out and they won't be at home for the whole weekend. And the great
thing about it is that the same weekend belongs to LD30! So I thought to
myself: why not try to sign in? And here I am.

So after 10h of design and development (Inkscape, GIMP, PyxelEdit, VS
C++ & SFML lib) I've achieved the following state:

- Simple rendering engine using stack states is done
- Resources management (textures, fonts) is finished
- Level loader that uses .png files as its input is finished
- Level mechanics
- Simple assets are finished: menu background, game background and

Still to be done:

- Collision detection, this is main mechanics
- Player movement based on gravity
- Audio effects & Music (there's gonna be no music probably as I don't 
  know much about this topic)
- Sprite polishing
- Better input handling: Joystick support + rebindable keys
- Maybe (big maybe) PCG-ed levels
