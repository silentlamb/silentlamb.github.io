This article is an imported post from Ludum Dare website. I've posted it
at the day 1 of LD33 event. It's added here so I can keep everything related
to a gamedev in a single place.

### Day 1

Hello Ludum Dare-ers! I hope you're enjoying both compo and the theme. Day&nbsp;1 is
almost done so let me summarize my work today:

**Finished**:

- Testing custom engine for the first time; not working perfectly, but not as
  bad as the last time.
- Main character animations and some static assets
- Integration with Box2D. Tons of stupid issues to resolve. Good lesson.
- Loading level from .png files.

**TODO for Day 2**:

- Enemies: path finding, very simple AI
- More gfx/sfx assets
- Rendering optimizations and fixes
- Juicing the game up (screen shakes, explosions!)
- Design more levels and simple plot structure
- Come up with the title...

Not sure what's going to be dropped. I guess it's the music and more polished
assets again.
