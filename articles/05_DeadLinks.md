Recently I've been cleaning up old articles when I stumbled upon a problem
with dead links. Some of the articles written 1-2 years ago was linking
to non-existing pages. For example, I've deleted engine project from a github 
and link is valid no more. This post will describe a pelican plugin to 
notify or/and deal with said issue.

TODO.
