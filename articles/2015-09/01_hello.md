Title: Introduction to the blog

Status: published

The blog is finally setup and running. Under the hood the software I use
is [Pelican][1] to generate static HTML files from articles written in
Markdown/RST format. Everything is hosted as a [Github pages feature][2]
configured to support my custom domain. Time for introduction!

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

### Who am I

As the header states my name is Marcin Gli≈Ñski. I'm a software engineer
working in a mobile company in projects related to Android and audio
processing. The topics related to my work probably won't show up much
often here as I'm not sure how far can I go with NDA.

In my non-professional time I learn and discover various fields of game
design and development.  Currently I am in the middle of preparing a
toy-engine, written mostly for learning purposes, to be open sourced.
If the time is right I participate in [Ludum Dare competition][3].
Having a hard limit of 48h (or 72, depending on the event) to create
game from scratch, is a very challenging task.

### Topics of this blog

The main topics of this blog are engine and game development. My pet
project is a game with top-down perspective mixing various games into
the one.

The engine itself is written in C++ using SFML library as a OpenGL and
system wrapper. For physics system I've chosen Box2D as it's simple
enough to work with. For a scripting language I use Lua. These
technologies will be shown in my articles for sure.

When I don't do any gamedev, I play some indie games. My favourite
genres are roguelikes, top down shooters and platformers. If I find
anything intresting, reviews will be added here as well.


### Reason to write

There is no progress without training. The main reason is to improve my english
writting skills. Creating doxygen/code documentation (especially when you work
with people from Asia) is one thing as you need to write as simple as possible
to be easily understood. Passing your thoughts into a web article is something
completely different. 

### What else to find here

The previous blog under this domain was made to group my ASCII-arts in a single
place.  I don't want them to disappear in the vastness of web archives as they
are part of me.  Altough I don't draw them anymore as my current interests are
pixel and low poly arts, the amount of arts that I created is kind of big and I
want them to be here.
