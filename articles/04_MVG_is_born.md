January is a funny month. Gyms and swimming pools all over the world record 
increased gainings. Side walks are full of wannabe runners and tobacco 
industry records decline in profits.

I've decided to join the New Year's train and start something new. There are 
stories that happen to start with "Once upon a time". There a stories that 
begins with "So, you wanna hear another story, eh?". My story starts with...

This single person hobby project called "Melted Vertex Games" with a
bit of luck and dozen of determination will hopefully create new chapter 
in my life. You know how they say, "Start small, dream big". And that's 
what I'm going to do.

The project is not abandoned, although not much is happening. The work is 
being done at the very slow pace. The main reason is that my main job requires
for me to learn a lot of new technology as well as refresh some forgotten knowledge.

The MVE game engine I've been using for Ludum Dare compo is still under development.
I've decided to drop SFML library as it's been harder and harder for me to implement
new features that use a bit of raw OpenGL. Since the MVE engine has been started as 
a place for me to learn gamedev engine designs and inner working, I feel like dropping 
SFML in a favor of raw OpenGL was a good idea.

I've been learning and refreshing a lot of DSP related topics and I hope to use
the knowledge in a game development field as soon as time permits.
