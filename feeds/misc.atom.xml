Under the hood the software I use
is &lt;a href="http://getpelican.com"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; to generate static HTML files from articles written in
Markdown/RST format. Everything is hosted as a &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com"&gt;Github pages feature&lt;/a&gt;
configured to support my custom domain. Time for introduction!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Who am I&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the header states my name is Marcin Gliński. I'm a software engineer
working in a mobile company in projects related to Android and audio
processing. The topics related to my work probably won't show up much
often here as I'm not sure how far can I go with NDA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my non-professional time I learn and discover various fields of game
design and development.  Currently I am in the middle of preparing a
toy-engine, written mostly for learning purposes, to be open sourced.
If the time is right I participate in &lt;a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/rules/"&gt;Ludum Dare competition&lt;/a&gt;.
Having a hard limit of 48h (or 72, depending on the event) to create
game from scratch, is a very challenging task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Topics of this blog&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main topics of this blog are engine and game development. My pet
project is a game with top-down perspective mixing various games into
the one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The engine itself is written in C++ using SFML library as a OpenGL and
system wrapper. For physics system I've chosen Box2D as it's simple
enough to work with. For a scripting language I use Lua. These
technologies will be shown in my articles for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I don't do any gamedev, I play some indie games. My favourite
genres are roguelikes, top down shooters and platformers. If I find
anything intresting, reviews will be added here as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reason to write&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no progress without training. The main reason is to improve my english
writting skills. Creating doxygen/code documentation (especially when you work
with people from Asia) is one thing as you need to write as simple as possible
to be easily understood. Passing your thoughts into a web article is something
completely different. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What else to find here&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous blog under this domain was made to group my ASCII-arts in a single
place.  I don't want them to disappear in the vastness of web archives as they
are part of me.  Altough I don't draw them anymore as my current interests are
pixel and low poly arts, the amount of arts that I created is kind of big and I
want them to be here.&lt;/p&gt;
