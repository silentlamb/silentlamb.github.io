{"name":"Silentlamb.GitHub.io","tagline":"","body":"### Blog\r\n\r\nThe whole website is under construction right now. I'm working my way to blogging mostly about programming related stuff I discover every day. The most common topic is going to be game development. I don't work in this field of software engineering, but I rather treat is as my off-work hobby.\r\n\r\nI have no idea when this site is going to be finished as I want to test static content generators first, like Pelican.\r\n\r\n### Topics\r\n\r\n- Game development (Ludum Dare, my toy engine and the roguelite top-down shooter development diary)\r\n- ASCII-Arts, Pixel arts (archive/gallery of my arts)\r\n- Calisthenics (if I find the articles intresting for potential readers, and keep my motivation up and running)\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n\r\nYou may contact me via twitter [@loginavailable](https://twitter.com/loginavailable).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
